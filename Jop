Features
Traffic Monitoring: Real-time monitoring of network traffic to identify potential DDoS attacks.
Anomaly Detection: Algorithms to detect unusual traffic patterns indicative of DDoS attacks.
Rate Limiting: Tools to limit the rate of incoming traffic to prevent overwhelming the server.
IP Blacklisting: Automatic and manual blacklisting of IP addresses identified as sources of malicious traffic.
Alerting System: Notifications and alerts to inform administrators of potential attacks.
Scalability: Designed to scale with your infrastructure, supporting both small and large networks.
